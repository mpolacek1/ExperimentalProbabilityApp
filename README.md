# ExperimentalProbabilityApp

# School project
Once I have done what I need to, the project will be abandoned.

# Monte Carlo Principle
The main point of the project is to make an app that can calculate experimental probability with specific given instructions using the Monte Carlo simulation.

# Web version
So I decided that after I have completed the necessary parts of the project I am going to make a web version of the wpf apllication. After I am done with it, I will try to make the web version wrapped as an wpf app.
